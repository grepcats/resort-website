    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="intro">A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p>
    <p>Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>
    <p>If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. We'll make some happy little bushes here. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.</p>
